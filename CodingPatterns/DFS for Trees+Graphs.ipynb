    "\n",
    "- DFS is a recursive algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.\n",
    "- It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node for a graph) and goes as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "- DFS uses a **stack** (LIFO). 2 options:\n",
    "    - Recursive-> Implicit call stack(small graph, easy implementation)\n",
    "    - Iterative -> Explicit stack (deep graphs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General DFS Steps (Pseudocode)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the root or an arbitrary node.\n",
    "2. Mark the current node as visited.\n",
    "3. For each unvisited adjacent node:\n",

    "## 1. DFS for Trees\n",
    "- DFS is optimal for searching a tree that’s deeper than wide\n",
    "- DFS in trees is more intuitive & almost always uses recursive traversal like Preorder, Inorder, or Postorder.\n",
    "- Both iterative & recursive approaches for preorder, inorder and postorder have Time=O(n), Space=O(h)\n",
    "- BFS (Level Order) is less common but is useful for problems like finding the shortest path in unweighted trees.\n",
    "- Use **iterative DFS** approach for trees when dealing with deep or unbalanced trees to avoid stack overflow and have more control over the process. -> safer\n",
    "    - **Unbalanced binary tree**: If a tree is extremely skewed (like a LL), the recursion depth can approach `O(n)`, `n`=number of nodes.\n",
    "    - **Balanced binary tree**: Recursion depth is `O(log n)`-> manageable for most practical cases.\n",
    "- Tree traversal usually refers to **binary trees**. \n",
    "- DFS&BFS are still valid for **N-ary trees**, but traversal techniques like Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder only apply to binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tree DFS (Depth-First Search)** pattern is used to traverse a tree by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. \n",
    "- Recursive Exploration: Used when we need to explore all possible paths or calculate properties like depth, path sums, or the diameter of a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problems that involve traversing or exploring all possible paths in a tree or deep dive into subtrees.\n",
    "- Questions asking to calculate properties like the depth, sum of nodes, or checking for specific conditions in a tree.\n",
    "- Look for phrases like \"all paths,\" \"deepest node,\" or \"recursive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Start at the root of the tree (or any node in case of graphs).\n",
    "2. Explore one branch fully before moving to the next.\n",
    "3. Use a stack (or recursion) to keep track of the nodes to be visited.\n",
    "4. Process nodes in a 'deep-first' manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "- For Inorder, we do something **between** left and right.\n",
    "- For Preorder, we do something **before** left and right.\n",
    "- For Postorder, we do something **after** left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)**\n",
    "- Use when you need nodes processed in sorted (ascending) order. Most useful for BSTs.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "    - **BSTs**: Retrieves elements in sorted order.\n",
    "    - **Expression Trees**: Infix expression notation.\n",
    "- **Keywords**: \"Sorted order\", \"BST property\", \"Ascending/Descending order\".\n",
    "- **Recursive Approach**:\n",
    "    - Process the **left subtree**, then the **current node (root)**, and then the **right subtree**.\n",
    "    - Typically used when you want the nodes of a BST in sorted order.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Version 1: Using a helper function (BP)**:\n",
    "- It separates the traversal logic from the result accumulation, leading to a clean, modular solution. The recursive depth is bounded by the height of the tree, making space complexity dependent on the height.\n",
    "- Separation of Concerns: Encapsulating the recursive logic in a helper function helps keep the main function focused on handling inputs and outputs. It separates the traversal logic & result accumulation. \n",
    "- Clarity: This structure improves readability by clearly defining the flow of the traversal logic.\n",
    "- Simplified Base Case Handling (root=None) w/o cluttering the main function. \n",
    "- **Avoiding Global States or Mutable Variables:** Reduce the risk of bugs in concurrent scenarios or complex apps->esp. important in multi-threaded environments.\n",
    "- Easier Debugging: You can add debugging statements or print outputs specific to the recursive calls w/o affecting the main function’s interface.\n",
    "- Performance: In some cases, having a single, mutable result list that you append to (as opposed to creating new lists each time) can be more efficient in terms of both time and space, especially in deep trees."
