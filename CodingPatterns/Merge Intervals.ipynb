    "## 4. Merge Intervals:\n",
    "### **Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically used with arrays (lists) of intervals, where each interval is a sub-array or tuple.\n",
    "- Sorting is often a key step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intervals often overlap or need to be merged. The pattern focuses on either merging intervals or identifying intersections.\n",
    "- Problems in this pattern usually involve operations based on the start and end values of the intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look for problems dealing with intervals, ranges, or appointments.\n",
    "- Keywords: merge, intervals, overlap, intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smart interview comment:** \"The Merge Intervals pattern often starts with sorting the intervals and then efficiently identifying overlaps using a single pass through the list. This is common in problems where ranges or time intervals need to be merged or managed.\"\n",
    "- **Key Insight:** Sorting intervals by start time is crucial, as it allows merging adjacent intervals in one pass. Sorting dominates the time complexity.\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:** This pattern typically involves sorting, which costs `O(N log N)`. The merge operation is linear, which balances it out, but sorting can't be avoided if intervals need to be in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem 1: Merge Intervals**\n",
    "- **Problem:** Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the intervals based on their start time.\n",
    "2. Initialize an empty list, **`merged`**, to store the merged intervals.\n",
    "3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:\n",
    "    - If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in **`merged`**, merge them by updating the end time of the last interval.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, add the current interval to **`merged`**.\n",
    "4. Return the **`merged`** list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can the intervals have negative start and end times?\n",
    "- Can the intervals have overlapping ranges?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(N log N)` (Sorting: `O(N log N)`, Merging: `O(N)`)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for the result list->worst case=all intervals are non-overlapping and need to be merged\n"
