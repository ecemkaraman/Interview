    "The **Top K Elements** pattern is used to find the `k` largest or smallest elements in an unsorted dataset. The most efficient way to solve these problems is by using a **heap**, which allows us to efficiently track the k largest or smallest elements.\n",

    "- The problem explicitly asks for the \"top k\" largest/smallest elements.\n",
    "- Keywords: \"k largest,\" \"k smallest,\" \"frequent,\" \"least frequent.\"\n",

    "### **Steps in the Top K Elements Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heap Initialization**: Use a heap (min-heap for top k largest or max-heap for top k smallest). You can also use a priority queue based on the programming language.\n",
    "2. **Heapify**: For a list of elements, insert the first k elements into the heap. Maintain the heap size by removing elements based on their priority (e.g., remove smallest from a min-heap if you’re looking for k largest elements).\n",
    "3. **Iterate**: Traverse through the rest of the elements and keep comparing them with the root of the heap.\n",
    "4. **Maintain Heap**: For each element, if it meets the condition to be in the heap (greater/smaller than root), add it to the heap and remove the least desired element.\n",
    "5. **Extract Elements**: Once processed, the heap will contain the top k elements, which can be extracted or returned as the result."
