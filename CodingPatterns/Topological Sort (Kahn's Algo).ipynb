    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topological sort is used to order the vertices of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** in such a way that for every directed edge `U -> V`, vertex `U` comes before vertex `V` in the ordering.\n",
    "- **Kahn’s Algorithm** is an iterative algorithm that uses an **in-degree** array and a **queue** to generate the topological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem involves scheduling tasks or dependencies where one task must be completed before another.\n",
    "- The graph is **directed**, and the problem states there should be no cycles.\n",
    "- Acyclic-> Dependency Chains: There is a hierarchy or ordering of tasks, where tasks have prerequisites \n",
    "- Keywords: \"task scheduling,\" \"order of completion,\" \"dependencies.\"\n",

    "### **Steps in Kahn’s Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-degree Calculation**: Create an in-degree array that keeps track of how many edges point to each node (how many prerequisites each node has).\n",
    "2. **Initialize Queue**: Add all nodes with an in-degree of 0 (no prerequisites) to a queue.\n",
    "3. **Process Nodes**: While the queue is not empty, remove a node from the queue and add it to the result (the topological order).\n",
    "4. **Reduce In-degree**: For each neighbor of the processed node, reduce its in-degree by 1 (since its prerequisite has been completed). If the in-degree of a neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.\n",
    "5. **Cycle Detection**: If at the end, all nodes have been processed (queue is empty), the graph is acyclic, and the topological order is valid. If not, there is a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges (prerequisite relations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `O(V + E)` due to the storage of the adjacency list and in-degree array.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "### **Key Steps in This Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-degree Calculation**: For each node, calculate how many edges point to it (in-degree).\n",
    "2. **Queue Initialization**: Start with nodes that have an in-degree of 0 (no dependencies).\n",
    "3. **Queue Processing**: Process each node, update in-degrees of neighboring nodes, and add any newly \"independent\" nodes to the queue.\n",
    "4. **Cycle Detection**: Ensure that all nodes can be processed. If not, the graph contains a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Smart Interview Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cycle Detection:** \"Kahn’s Algorithm can detect cycles by checking if the number of nodes processed matches the number of nodes in the graph. If fewer nodes are processed, there is a cycle.\"\n",
    "- **Efficient Scheduling:** \"This method efficiently handles task scheduling and dependency problems, especially in scenarios like course scheduling or project planning.\"\n",
    "- **Topological Order Applications:** \"Topological sort is useful not just for course schedules but also for dependency resolution in software builds or even finding the order of execution for system tasks.\"\n",
