    "### Steps to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Queue**: Start with the root node in the queue and set the direction to left-to-right.\n",
    "2. **Level-by-Level Traversal**:\n",
    "    - For each level, gather all the node values.\n",
    "    - If the current level is odd, reverse the order of values before adding them to the result.\n",
    "    - Enqueue child nodes for the next level.\n",
    "3. **Toggle Direction**: After processing each level, toggle the direction for the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direction Toggle**: `left_to_right` is toggled at the end of each level to alternate the direction for the next level.\n",
    "- **Current Level Handling**: If `left_to_right` is `True`, node values are appended in normal order; otherwise, they're inserted at the beginning, creating a reversed order.\n",
    "- **Queue Management**: The queue ensures that nodes are processed level by level, and their children are enqueued for subsequent levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Interview Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"This BFS-based approach ensures we only process each node once and uses a toggle mechanism to reverse node order for odd levels efficiently.\"*\n",

    "### All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree (863, Tree, Medium)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Given a binary tree, a target node, and an integer `K`, return all nodes that are exactly `K` distance from the target node.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: The tree is directed, so we can’t go back from children to parents directly. We need to consider both upward (parent) and downward (children) connections.\n",
    "- To solve this, we convert the tree into an undirected graph using a **parent map**. This way, we can perform BFS from the target node and easily move both to children and back to parents.\n",
    "- BFS is optimal for shortest path. DFS is more complex bc we need to handle depth tracking & potential revisits more intricately, might require additional recursive calls.\n",
    "- **Space**: `O(N)` -> queue, parent_map \n",
    "- **Time**:`O(N)` we process each node once while building the parent map and again during BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Parent Map**: Traverse the tree and store each node’s parent. This helps in navigating upwards from the target node during BFS.\n",
    "2. **Perform BFS from Target Node**: Use a BFS queue to explore all nodes starting from the target node. We’ll stop when we reach nodes at a distance `K`.\n",
    "3. **Collect Result**: At each level of BFS, if the distance from the target equals `K`, add those nodes to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build Parent Map**: To treat the tree as an undirected graph->Allow upward traversal during BFS. The `dfs` function populates `parent_map` for each node, associating it with its parent. This is crucial for allowing upward traversal.\n",
    "- **BFS Traversal**: Using a queue, we perform BFS from the target node, incrementing the distance until `K` is reached. The visited set ensures nodes are processed only once.\n",
    "- **Result Accumulation**: Nodes are added to the result list when `distance == K`, ensuring only nodes exactly at distance `K` are collected."
