    "- DFS dives deep into a structure, ideal for backtracking and exhaustive search.\n",
    "- BFS explores level by level, perfect for shortest path and minimal distance scenarios.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BFS explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "- BFS uses a **queue** (FIFO) to track nodes to visit next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **General BFS Steps (Pseudocode)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\n",
    "2. While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "    - Pop the first node.\n",
    "    - For each unvisited adjacent node:\n",
    "        - Mark it as visited and add it to the queue."

    "- For wide, shallow trees, use BFS\n",
    "- BFS is more memory intensive than DFS -> **Queue** stores pointers = more memory\n",
    "- BFS is almost always implemented **iteratively** using a **queue**.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n), since all nodes are visited.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing nodes in the queue.\n",
    "- BFS is best suited for shortest path calculation in unweighted graphs. It can be applied on weighted graphs for other purposes-e.g. exploring reachable nodes, level-order traversal, or finding connected components.\n",
    "- It visits all neighbor nodes first and then move on to next-level neighbors, and so on. \n",
    "- The outer loop runs until the queue is empty, and the inner loop iterates through all nodes at the current level, enqueuing their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problems that involve processing nodes **level by level** & return results from each level.\n",
    "- Find the **shortest path** from the root, min depth/breadth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Interview Comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"I chose BFS because it’s particularly suited for level-order traversal and ensures that I visit nodes at each depth before moving deeper.\"*\n",
    "- *\"The `deque` is optimal here because it provides efficient O(1) operations for both enqueue and dequeue, which is essential for BFS traversal.\"*\n",
    "- *\"Although BFS can be implemented recursively, an iterative queue-based approach is more natural for BFS due to the need for an explicit data structure to track nodes level by level.\"*\n",
    "- *\"BFS is advantageous in scenarios where finding the shortest path in an unweighted tree is needed, as it guarantees exploration layer by layer.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PSEUDOCODE\n",
    "1. **Queue Initialization:** A `deque` (double-ended queue) is used to initialize the queue with the root node -> efficient `popleft` from front.\n",
    "2. **Outer While Loop:** Runs until queue=empty. Each iteration processes one level of the tree.\n",
    "3. **Inner For Loop:** Iterates through each node at the current level, pop the node, append node.val to `level_nodes[]`, and append its children to `queue[]`. \n",
    "4. **Result Collection:** After traversing each level, append `level_nodes[]` to `result`. "
