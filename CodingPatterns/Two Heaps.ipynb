    "### **Two Heaps Pattern Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Min-Heap** (used to store the larger half of the data).\n",
    "- **Max-Heap** (used to store the smaller half of the data, with inverted values to simulate a Max-Heap in languages where only Min-Heap is supported like Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pattern is used for problems where you need to efficiently access or calculate the median (or another middle element) in a dynamic set of numbers. Two heaps allow you to maintain a balance between the lower half and upper half of the dataset.\n",
    "- Typically, the smaller half is maintained in a Max-Heap (with negative values for simulation in Python), and the larger half in a Min-Heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem will ask for operations on dynamic streams or sequences of numbers.\n",
    "- The challenge is to find or maintain the **median** or a value close to the median.\n",
    "- Keywords: median, dynamically track, stream, running median.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smart interview comment:** \"The Two Heaps pattern is ideal for efficiently managing the balance of dynamically updated datasets, such as finding the median in a stream of numbers or solving problems that require prioritizing one subset of elements over another. The heaps allow for efficient insertion and extraction of values, making the solution optimal in terms of both time and space.\"\n",
    "- **Key Insight:** Maintaining balance between the two heaps is the most critical part of the pattern. You need to ensure that the Max-Heap never has more than one extra element compared to the Min-Heap.\n",
    "- **Variations:** The pattern is commonly used in problems involving dynamic median calculation or prioritization of capital/profit."
