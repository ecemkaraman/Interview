    "### **In-place Reversal of Linked List Pattern Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Structures:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singly Linked List**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **In-place Reversal** pattern is useful for problems where you are required to reverse a part of the linked list, or the entire list, without using additional memory.\n",
    "- The approach usually involves adjusting the pointers of the linked list nodes directly as you traverse them.\n",
    "- This pattern helps with problems like reversing a linked list, reversing a sublist, or rearranging linked list nodes in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem will ask to reverse the nodes or adjust the order of elements within a linked list.\n",
    "- You are required to do it **in-place**, which means without using extra memory (i.e., no extra arrays or lists).\n",
    "- Keywords: reverse, reorder, rotate, rearrange, in-place."

    "### **Key Steps in This Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Three Pointers Setup:**\n",
    "    - **previous:** Holds the previously reversed node (initially `None`).\n",
    "    - **current:** The node being processed.\n",
    "    - **next_node:** A temporary pointer to the next node so the chain can be reconnected after reversing.\n",
    "2. **Reversing:**\n",
    "    - Change the `.next` pointer of `current` to point to `previous`.\n",
    "    - Move all pointers one step forward.\n",
    "3. **Restoration:**\n",
    "    - After reversing a portion of the list, reconnect the newly reversed section with the rest of the list (especially for sublist reversals).\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Smart Interview Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-place efficiency:** \"This solution operates in constant space, making it memory efficient as we do not use any additional data structures. We rely solely on pointer manipulation to reverse the list.\"\n",
    "- **Edge cases:** \"We ensure that edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with a single node, are handled gracefully by checking the base conditions.\"\n",
    "- **Time efficiency:** \"Since we traverse the linked list in one pass (`O(N)`), the solution is time-optimal for this type of problem.\"\n",
    "- **Real-world analogy:** \"This pattern mimics swapping train cars on a track where we rearrange nodes one by one while ensuring we don't lose the rest of the train.\"\n",
    "***\n",
    "### **Variations and Extensions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rotate Linked List:** Instead of reversing, sometimes you need to rotate the list (move elements from one end to the other).\n",
    "- **Rearrange Linked List:** This pattern can also be useful for problems where elements need to be rearranged in a specific way, not just reversed."
