    "### K-Way Merge Pattern Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **K-Way Merge** pattern deals with merging `k` sorted arrays or lists. The main idea is to efficiently merge multiple sorted data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, or streams) into one sorted list. This pattern often leverages **min-heaps (priority queues)** for efficient extraction of the minimum (or maximum) element among the `k` structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are given multiple sorted lists, arrays, or streams and asked to merge them into a single sorted list.\n",
    "- The problem involves sorting or finding the smallest (or largest) elements across multiple sorted collections.\n",
    "- The use of a min-heap (or max-heap) can simplify finding the next element to add to the merged structure.\n",
    "- The goal is typically to merge or identify elements in `k` sorted structures efficiently."

    "### **Steps in the K-Way Merge Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Min-Heap:**\n",
    "    - For merging, the min-heap helps in efficiently extracting the smallest element among all lists. Each entry in the heap represents an element and the list it comes from.\n",
    "2. **Insert the First Element from Each List:**\n",
    "    - Start by inserting the first element from each of the `k` lists into the min-heap. Each element should be inserted along with information about which list it belongs to and its index in the list.\n",
    "3. **Extract the Minimum Element:**\n",
    "    - Remove the smallest element from the heap and add it to the result list (this ensures that the result list is sorted).\n",
    "4. **Insert the Next Element from the Same List:**\n",
    "    - After extracting an element, insert the next element from the same list into the min-heap (if it exists). Repeat the process until all elements from all lists are merged.\n",
    "5. **Return the Result:**\n",
    "    - Once the heap is empty, return the merged result list."

    "- Inserting each element into the heap takes `O(log k)`, and there are `n * k` elements across all `k` lists. The overall time complexity is `O(n * k * log k)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Merging `k` Sorted Arrays**: Use a min-heap to merge the arrays, similar to the Linked List example.\n",
    "2. **Finding Top-K Smallest/Largest Elements Across Lists**: By modifying the heap to store either smallest or largest elements, you can solve problems that require top-k elements.\n",
    "3. **Generalized Sliding Window**: The smallest range problem can be generalized to other types of range queries by dynamically managing both the smallest and largest elements.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Min-Heap Efficiency**: The min-heap allows efficient extraction of the smallest element, which is crucial in merging sorted data.\n",
    "- **Keeping Track of Metadata**: It's often necessary to store not just the value but also the index of the list and the element within that list, so you can retrieve the next element easily."
