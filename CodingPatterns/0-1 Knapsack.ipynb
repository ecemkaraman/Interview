    "### 0/1 Knapsack Pattern Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **0/1 Knapsack** pattern is one of the most fundamental dynamic programming patterns and involves making decisions where each item can either be selected (1) or not selected (0). It’s commonly used when we need to make a selection among items with different weights and values, subject to certain constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **0/1 Knapsack** problem is about finding the maximum value you can carry in a knapsack of fixed capacity, where you can either include or exclude each item. This leads to subproblems, making it a classic example of dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Recognize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are given items with values and weights, and you need to choose a subset of these items such that their combined weight does not exceed a specified limit (capacity).\n",
    "- The problem asks for the \"maximum profit,\" \"maximum value,\" or something similar, while respecting a given constraint.\n",
    "- The problem involves making choices for each item (include/exclude) while maintaining a constraint like weight or capacity."

    "### **Steps in the 0/1 Knapsack Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Subproblem:**\n",
    "    - Typically, define a 2D DP table (`dp[i][c]`) where `i` is the number of items considered and `c` is the current capacity.\n",
    "    - Each entry represents the maximum value achievable by considering the first `i` items with a capacity of `c`.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Transition:**\n",
    "    - If the current item’s weight exceeds the current capacity, you cannot include it: `dp[i][c] = dp[i-1][c]`.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, choose the maximum between including or excluding the current item:\n",
    "        - Include the current item: `value[i] + dp[i-1][c - weight[i]]`\n",
    "        - Exclude the current item: `dp[i-1][c]`\n",
    "3. **Initialize DP Table:**\n",
    "    - Set all values to 0 where no items are considered or the capacity is 0, as the maximum value in both cases will always be 0.\n",
    "4. **Iterate Over All Items and Capacities:**\n",
    "    - Loop through all items and all capacities to fill the DP table.\n",
    "5. **Return Result:**\n",
    "    - The final answer will be in `dp[n][capacity]`, where `n` is the total number of items and `capacity` is the given capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is `O(n * C)`, where `n` is the number of items and `C` is the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is `O(n * C)` for the DP table, but it can be optimized to `O(C)` using a 1D array.\n",

    "### **Core Variations and Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unbounded Knapsack**: Items can be selected multiple times (e.g., coin change problems). Here, the only change is allowing multiple selections of an item.\n",
    "2. **Subset Sum Problems**: These are direct applications of the 0/1 knapsack where you're checking if a subset with a given sum exists.\n",
    "3. **Space Optimization**: By iterating in reverse for capacity, you can reduce space complexity to `O(C)` instead of `O(n * C)`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interview Breakdown and Smart Comments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: \"The core insight is breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems. For each item, we either include it in the knapsack or exclude it, based on the total value and the capacity remaining.\"\n",
    "2. **Trade-off Considerations**: \"The problem can also be solved using recursion with memoization, but the bottom-up DP approach is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space.\"\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**: \"The time complexity is `O(n * C)`, where `n` is the number of items and `C` is the knapsack capacity. This is optimal given the need to explore all possible subsets of items.\"\n",
    "4. **Space Complexity**: \"While the DP table uses `O(n * C)` space, this can be reduced to `O(C)` using a 1D array that gets updated in reverse order.\""
