    "### Summary of Similarities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem Structure**: All problems involve grid traversal, typically with DFS/BFS.\n",
    "- **Goal**: Whether counting islands, calculating areas, or propagating changes (like color or distance), these problems require processing connected components.\n",
    "- **Core Algorithm**: DFS/BFS can be applied to all, while Union-Find may be used for more advanced cases (like counting components in certain graph problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tradeoff Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DFS**: Good for recursive traversal but risks stack overflow for large grids.\n",
    "- **BFS**: More suitable for iterative solutions, avoids stack overflow, but can consume more memory due to queue usage.\n",
    "- **Union-Find**: Best for problems where we repeatedly query connected components, but its complexity is higher for simpler grid-based problems like these."
