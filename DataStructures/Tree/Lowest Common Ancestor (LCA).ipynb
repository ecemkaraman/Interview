    "- **Description**: Finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree or BST.\n",
    "- LCA(p,q) is the lowest/deepest node in a tree that has both (p,q) nodes as descendants.\n",
    "- LCA = The point where the paths from both nodes to the root intersect for the 1st time.\n",
    "- LCA is an **ancestor** of both nodes-> always located **above or at the same level** as the two nodes, never below them. \n",
    "    - Aka the \"parent\"(or grandparent etc) that both nodes share.\n",
